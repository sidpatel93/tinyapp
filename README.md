## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser (Depreciated. From Express version 4.16 and above body-parser comes inbuilt with the frame work. So we are using that in this application.)

## Getting Started

- Clone this reposetory and `cd` in to that newly created folder.
- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Getting Started

After running the development server using `node express_server.js` command, you can access the application on `localhost:8080/`. If logged in, the home page will show all the short URLs you have created or redirect to Login page if not logged in.
